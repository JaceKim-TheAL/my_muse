### Your Idol

Pray for me now
Pray for me now (Dies irae)
Pray for me now (Illa)
Pray for me now (Vos solve in)
Pray for me now (Favilla)
Pray for me now (Maledictus)
Pray for me now (Erus)
Pray for me now (In flamas)
Pray for me now (Eternum)
I'll be your idol

Keeping you in check (Uh), keeping you obsessed (Uh)
Play me on repeat, 끝없이 in your head
Anytime it hurts (Uh), play another verse (Uh)
I can be your sanctuary
Know I'm the only one right now (Now)
I will love you more when it all burns down
More than power, more than gold (Yeah)
Yeah, you gave me your heart, now I'm here for your soul

I'm the only one who'll love your sins
Feel the way my voice gets underneath your skin

Listen 'cause I'm preachin' to the choir
Can I get the mic a little higher?
Gimme your desire
I can be the star you rely on (You rely on)
내 황홀에 취해, you can't look away (Hey)
Don't you know I'm here to save you
Now we runnin' wild
Yeah, I'm all you need, I'ma be your idol

Uh
Uh

Uh, 빛이 나는 fame, 계속 외쳐, I'm your idol
Thank you for the pain 'cause it got me going viral
Uh, yeah, 낫지 않는 fever, makin' you a believer
나를 위해 넌 존재하는 아이들
Don't let it show, keep it all inside
The pain and the shame, keep it outta sight
Your obsession feeds our connection
이 순간 give me all your attention

You know I'm the only one who'll love your sins
Feel the way my voice gets underneath your skin

Listen 'cause I'm preachin' to the choir
Can I get the mic a little higher?
Gimme your desire
I can be the star you rely on (You rely on)
내 황홀에 취해, you can't look away (Yeah)
Don't you know I'm here to save you
Now we runnin' wild
Yeah, I'm all you need, I'ma be your idol

Be your idol

Living in your mind now
Too late 'cause you're mine now
I will make you free
When you're all part of me

(Listen 'cause I'm) Preaching to the choir
(Now) Can I get the mic a little higher?
Gimme your desire
Watch me set your world on fire
내 황홀에 취해, you can't look away (Hey)
No one is coming to save you
Now we runnin' wild
You're down on your knees, I'ma be your idol
